# AI-Based Smart Waste Management System

The **AI-Based Smart Waste Management System** is an innovative platform designed to revolutionize waste management by leveraging the power of AI and gamification. Our system enables users to report waste locations, collect and track waste efficiently, and provides a reward system to encourage active participation. This solution aims to promote community involvement in waste management while empowering staff with insightful reports based on platform data.

## Features

- **Waste Reporting and Collection Tracking**: Users can report waste locations, and the system tracks the waste collection process.
- **Data-Driven Reports for Staff**: Staff members can generate detailed reports based on platform data to gain insights into waste management activities.
- **Gamification for User Engagement**: Users earn points based on their activity such as reporting waste locations and garbage collection, fostering community engagement.
- **AI-Powered Waste Verification**: Utilizes Google Gemini AI to monitor waste levels, track amounts, and verify waste collection activities.
- **Address Auto-Completion**: Integrated with Google Maps API to provide seamless address auto-completion for user convenience.
